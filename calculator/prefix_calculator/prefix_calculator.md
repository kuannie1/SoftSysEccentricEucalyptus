# Lisp Calculator
## Motivation
Lisp is commonly used as a first class functional programming language. In this example, we have built a lisp like calculator to explore and understand how to use BISON and FLEX.

## How to build
`make calc`

## Examples
(+ 1 1) = 2  
(+ (+ 1 1) (- 2 1) (* 1 2) (/ 1 2)) = 5.5
