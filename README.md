# eLISP-Cs...

## Description
This repository contains two different implementations for a Lisp interpreter in C.
The first version we have is included within the `src` directory, and includes
heavy use of Yacc and Lex to assist with parsing. This version was significantly
assisted by Riccardo Pucella, visiting lecturer at Olin. Our conversations with
him guided much of the structure we used in the parsing and the interpreter.
The other version is included in the directory `ast_c`. This version was less guided
by the help of Dr. Pucella, but used
[Peter Norvigâ€™s Lispy interpreter](http://norvig.com/lispy.html), a Lisp
interpreter written in Python, as a reference. This version served more as an
exploration into how to build an abstract syntax tree and interpret it.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuannie1/SoftSysEccentricEucalyptus.git
sudo apt-get install flex bison
```

## Usage
### Using the Lex and Yacc based interpreter
```bash
cd SoftSysEccentricEucalyptus/src
make interpreter
./interpreter <lisp file>
```
There is a test lisp file included in the directory, called `test.lisp`.
### Using the parsing focused interpreter
```bash
cd SoftSysEccentricEucalyptus/ast_c
make interpreter
./interpreter <lisp file>
```
There is a test lisp file included in the directory, called `sample.lisp`.
